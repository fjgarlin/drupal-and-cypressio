## Run the examples

The provided scripts will run all the necessary commands to build the code used on the slides.
It assumes that some tools like `php`, `npm`, `composer`... are installed in your machine.

Some scripts require sudo just to delete the generated folders as Drupal marks them as read-only after install.
